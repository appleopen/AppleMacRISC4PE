	 * Notes on initPlatformSensor( const OSDictionary * ), initPlatformSensor( IOService * ),
	 * and registerDriver( IOSerivce *, const OSDictionary *, bool )
	 *
	 * These routines are cumulatively responsible for initializing an IOPlatformSensor object
	 * and making sure that all the correct data is supplied, parsed, and prioritized.  There
	 * are a number of properties inside a sensor.  Some can be declared by the thermal
	 * profile, some can be supplied by the registering driver, and some, if left unspecified,
	 * will be set to some default value.
	 *
	 * initPlatformSensor( const OSDictionary * ) is invoked when a sensor is being initialized
	 * from a thermal profile entry.  The OSDictionary parameter is the thermal profile entry.
	 *
	 * initPlatformSensor( IOService * ) is invoked when a sensor driver tries to register and
	 * its sensor-id is not found in the thermal profile.  The IOService parameter is the driver
	 * that is sending the registration.
	 *
	 * registerDriver( IOService *, const OSDictionary *, bool ) is invoked after one of the
	 * initPlatformSensor() routines has been invoked (and some of the parameters have already
	 * been set.
	 *
	 * The following properties are REQUIRED for successful completion of initPlatformSensor:
	 *	kIOPPluginSensorIDKey
	 *
	 * The following properties may be supplied by the thermal profile, but will be given
	 * default values if not specified (the sensor driver does not know about these
	 * properties):
	 *
	 *	kIOPPluginThermalLocalizedDescKey		"UNKNOWN_SENSOR"	<OSString>
	 *	kIOPPluginSensorFlagsKey				0x0					<OSNumber>
	 *
	 * The following properties are always supplied by the sensor driver (IOHWSensor) but, if
	 * specified, values in the thermal profile will take precedence and be used instead.
	 *
	 *	kIOPPluginTypeKey
	 *	kIOPPluginVersionKey
	 *	kIOPPluginLocationKey
	 *	kIOPPluginZoneKey
	 *
	 * The following parameters may not be supplied at all, by either the thermal profile
	 * or by the sensor driver.  The value will be searched for with the highest precedence
	 * on the thermal profile, then next on the sensor driver.  If not specified in either
	 * place, a default will be assigned.
	 *
	 *	kIOPPluginPollingPeriodKey				-1					<OSNumber>
